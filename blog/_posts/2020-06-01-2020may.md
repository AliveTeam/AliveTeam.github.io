Nemin has created a website for the project here: <https://aliveteam.github.io/>

Abe's Oddysee progress continues. It will likely be months before AO standalone gets to anywhere near booting. The main focus will be the game objects as the "core" engine code is mostly the same between AO and AE. Thus near the end AO can be forced to call the AE core functions to see what sticks.

The goal for this month is to implement from the entry point of AO to the Map class creating an instance of a completed object via the PathData Factory. I may also attempt to update the IDA scripts to report actual function count/percentage progress.

We also gained a few more supporters this month. I'll likely also be doing more dev streams   during this lockdown 'o doom. Stay safe out there.
