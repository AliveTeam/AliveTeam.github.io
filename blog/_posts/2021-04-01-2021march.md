Hello all,

This month had some exciting updates on multiple fronts. Paul is still chipping away at implementing
the new editor API, which will allow a much more sophisticated level editor to be added to the game.
Mouzedrift is helping him out by adding sane names to a ton of stuff that will be later editable in
the editor. MLG in the meantime has worked on rewriting the renderer code that will allow us to add
higher resolution backgrounds to the game. Hell, even I had some contributions this month!

As always here is the concrete list of who did what, see you next month:

### Mlgthatsme

- Worked on reworking the game's renderer to accomodate higher resolution images. You can see the
  WIP below (the sprite issues have been fixed since):
