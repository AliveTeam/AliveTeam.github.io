Hello all,

First of all, apologies for the late post, it just so happened that I've received the vaccine the
day before the post was supposed to come out, so I wasn't exactly in the state to write it.
Regardless, now I'm feeling much better and we can dive into this month's whodunnit.

But before that, we'd like to announce that the team started working on a new
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/)-based level editor, which can be found under
[this](https://github.com/AliveTeam/qt-editor) repository. The intention is for this editor to be
able to do everything Paul's Level Editor can and also provide additional features, along with being
able to save into JSON, which will be the new format in which levels are stored.

### [Paul]

- Fixed [bug #1227](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1227).
- Fixed [bug #1276](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1276).
- Did a lot of work on the JSON API that allows the game to convert between JSON (which is easily
  editable by hand or by a dedicated editor) and its own internal level format. This will be used
  for the level editor.
- Marked many classes `final`, this can prevent bugs later down the line.
- Merged AliveExeAO and AliveExeAE into relive.exe, which will automatically figure out which game
  the user is trying to play based on the files in the game folder.
- Refactored the OpenGL rendering.
- Refactored the code to compile faster and use less templates.
- Started working on a new level editor (as detailed above), that will allow a far more flexible way
  of editing and creating new levels for the Oddysee and Exoddus.
- Updated the version of SDL2 the project is using, this fixes a bug that caused hangups for people
  playing under Windows.

### [MLG]

- Added an experimental OpenGL renderer (currently the engine uses SDL's own rendering functions.)

### [Mouzedrift]

- Fixed [bug #1225](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1225).
- Corrected the README as it didn't use the project's proper name.

### [LIJI32]

- Made it so that the engine changes directory into the proper folder on MacOSX.

### [Pryon]

- Fixed a crash that was caused by launching the game using the DLL method.

### [Vee]

- Added support for [MinGW](http://mingw-w64.org/) compilation.
- Enabled [PCH](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/command/target_precompile_headers.html) and
  [unity](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/UNITY_BUILD.html) compilation in CMake (this
  results in greatly improved compilation times.)
- Improved code consistency using `clang-format`.
- Enabled more warnings during compilation.
- Refactored `relive_api`.
- Refactored `TlvFactory`.

### [Deanff]

- Fixed a really old bug where gamespeak keys had to be held down in Abe's Oddysee. Now it works
  like it does in Exoddus.
- Added chanting using shoulder buttons when using a gamepad.
- Added a way to exit the save menu using a gamepad.
- Fixed the pause menu to work like on the PS1.
- Fixed a death delay glitch.
- Fixed [bug #1032](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1032).
- Fixed [bug #1171](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1171).
- Fixed [bug #1174](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1174).

### [Nemin]

- Fixed the scripts that launch the game on Linux.
