July 2020 update

Current AO progress is:

overall complete funcs 34.14% (921/2698)

overall complete insts 27.36% (52276/191069)

As expected the goal of stubbing all objects was not hit, however it is very close as there is probably less than 7 left.

Plan for next month is to progress any object as much as possible. As you can see I've poured massive amount of time/effort in this month with this kind of raw progress increase! So probably I'll take it easier this month who knows, perhaps some peeps might actually help out more this month ;).
