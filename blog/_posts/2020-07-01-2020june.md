June 2020 update

Current AO progress is:

overall complete funcs 8.94% (241/2697)

overall complete insts 7.20% (13766/191067)

I am working through attempting to stub/implement the constructors of as many objects as possible to avoid context switching when implementing other objects that have a lot of dependencies.

Varrok was also starting to help out a little this month before he decided to blow up his PC. The goal/plan for next month is just keep on stubbing objects till its done. This could also run into July.
