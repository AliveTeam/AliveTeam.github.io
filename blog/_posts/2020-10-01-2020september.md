Hello all,

Previously blogposts used to be hosted over at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alive) (where you
can support the project if you'd like.) However, we figured it's better to have things more
centralized, so from now on blog posts will be posted on this page. For convenience, the older posts
have been migrated as well.

Onto more relevant business, the Oddysee reversing continues nicely, just a little while ago we
surpassed the halfway mark.

[Paul] implemented the AI brain for Paramites and worker Mudokons. He also worked on the Sligs', the
Elum's and the Scrabs' AI, implemented ChimeLocks, fixed some bugs and renamed a few functions to be
more easily understood.

[D3nwah] worked on functions related to Sligs shooting, including letting characters actually take
damage from gunshots. He also worked on Abe's interactions with the BOOM Machine, fixed two bugs,
started implementing doors and worked on timed bombs.

[Mouzedrift] fixed bugs and named fields too numerous to list here, including Slig, Scrab, Slog,
Paramite and Elum bugs. He also implemented a few AI functions and fixed a crash.

[THEONLYDarkShadow] gave proper names to a bunch of objects and fields, including Slurgs and Slogs
and also turned a few hardcoded integers into enums.

[UltraStars3000] gave proper names to states in the Slog, Slig and Paramite AI and named a bunch of
sound effects.

[Yours truly] leaned in on the user-facing side of things. I gave this site a new coat of paint,
created the blog section and created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-75zRX2PdXY)
showcasing R.E.L.I.V.E. running on Linux. My contributions to the project itself were in the form of
an AUR package for Arch Linux that can automatically install the engine, a small bash script that
tries to auto-detect where Oddworld is installed and prompts users to manually enter it if it can't
find it, and small tweaks to the CMake configuration files that enables it to install the game
properly.

All in all, the project is progressing quickly as nearly 12% more functions were reversed compared
to last month. This speed can also be "thanked" to the pandemic, that lets people spend more time on
developing the engine.
