Hello all,

Previously blogposts used to be hosted over at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alive) (where you
can support the project if you'd like.) However, we figured it's better to have things more
centralized, so from now on blog posts will be posted on this page. For convenience, the older posts
have been migrated as well.

Onto more relevant business, the Oddysee reversing continues nicely, just a little while ago we
surpassed the halfway mark. Below you can read a high-level overview of what has been done. If
you're interested in a more low-level look, feel free to click on the names which will take you to
the devs' respective commits.

266 files have been changed this month with 21,658 additions and 3,897 deletions.

[Paul]'s contributions this month largely concerned more AI functions. He implemented a bunch of
Slig behavior, finished Paramites, worked on Scrabs, Elum and Slogs. He also finished worker Mudokon
AI, fixed some bugs concerning Abe entering doors and Sligs mysteriously disappearing upon leaving
the screen and finally implemented some objects like Chimelocks and the cooler cousin of the
Security Orbs, the Security Claw.

[D3nwah] helped out with Parmaites, worked on functions related to Sligs shooting, including letting
characters actually take damage from gunshots. He also timed mines, worked on Abe's interactions
with lifts, doors and the BOOM Machine, and fixed a bunch of bugs including Paramites being too loud
and dying without any animations, thrown meat deciding to stop existing randomly, doors that don't
know their place and grenades not making a spectacular enough explosion.

[Mouzedrift] fixed bugs and named fields too numerous to list here, including Abe not being able to
turn into the Shrykull in some cases, Sligs randomly reloading and a particular Scrab and a Slig
acting like pacifists. His work also includes function implementations for Abe, Sligs, Slog AI,
Paramites, explosions, animations, falling items, particles and Elum. He also fixed a crash.

[THEONLYDarkShadow] gave proper names to a bunch of objects and fields, including Slurgs and Slogs
and also turned a few hardcoded integers into enums.

[UltraStars3000] gave proper names to states in the Slog, Slig and Paramite AI and named a bunch of
sound effects.

[Yours truly] leaned in on the user-facing side of things. I gave this site a new coat of paint,
created the blog section and created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-75zRX2PdXY)
showcasing R.E.L.I.V.E. running on Linux. I also made an AUR package and added a bash script that
helps users with locating their Exoddus install, along with tweaking the CMake config.

All in all, the project is progressing quickly as nearly 12% more functions were reversed compared
to last month. This speed can also be "thanked" to the pandemic, that lets people spend more time on
developing the engine.
