Current AO progress is:

**Overall Complete functions:** 50.67% (1178/2325)

**Overall Complete instructions:** 35.98% (67785/188420)

A massive leap in progress compared to last month. But also note the todo function count is now also a lot lower as many functions that won't need to be done have been removed from the count.

The progress at the end of the month fell of a cliff as covid restrictions ease up a little more and I've spent a lot more time offline for a change.

Plan for next month is more of the same, keep progressing more functions towards the end game. Expectation is that there will be a lot less next month due to IRL reasons and also because the complexity of remaining functions is getting higher and higher.

Since AO was compiled with MSVC5 compared to AE which was MSVC6 there is a lot of harder to reverse code as much more of it is inlined compared to AE and uses constructs that the decompiler doesn't really fully understand resulting in more to be done "by hand" which takes longer and increases the bug rate.

Shouts to the usual suspects for more documentation/testing/bug fixes & support.
