Hello all,

This month was a bit slower than usual, but as the common saying goes, doing the last 20% of things takes 80% of the time. 

There is one very piece of news that I think a lot of people will find exciting: Paul started to work on both a new renderer for the project which will enable us to add HD screens to the game and an Editor API, which will make it possible to write a whole new level editor for the engine that will make [Paul's Level Editor](/legacy) finally obsolete. The editor itself is currently worked on by rozniak, expect details about it later.

Here are the things the contributors added to the project this month: 

### [Paul]

* Fixed laughing gas rendering on Linux/OSX.
* Added DDCheat for AO using the same flag as in AE.
* Disabled loading to the save screen by default.
* Started implementing a DirectX / OpenGL render, which will later be used for HD screen support.
* Started implementing an editor API.
* Fixed a bug where Sligs didn't set off motion sensors.
* Fixed a crash that sometimes happened when Abe entered wells.

### [THEONLYDarkShadow]

* Fixed spelling and grammar in code.
* Named fields in:
    * `Glukkon`
    * `Scrab`
    * `Abe`
    * `Bullet`
    * `Movie`

### [D3nwah]

* Fixed [bug #1058](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1058).

### [Mouzedrift]

* Added Layer enum.
* Converted the velocity tables of Scrabs and Paramites to use fixed point values.
* Updated the description of the Hook manager in the [README].
* Named fields in:
    * `Fleech`
    * `Glukkon`
    * `Paramite`
    * `Scrab`
    * `Slig`
    * `Slog`

### [Pryon]

* Added controller support for AO.
* Refactored AO's input handling.
* Removed unnecessary macros in the code.

### [Nemin]

* Added a Linux launch script for AO.
* Fixed Debian packaging. It can now be downloaded from [Azure]
* Rewrote the project's [README].
