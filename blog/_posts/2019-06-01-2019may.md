This month the halfway line has been truly passed for both function count and instruction count.


Progress stands at:

 Overall Complete functions: 55.78 % (1639/2938)

Overall Complete instructions: 52.78 % (123720/234383)  


Objects progressed:

NakedSlig - partially started.

SlurgSpawner - probably works but it turns out working on this was a waste of time as its an object that is unused by the game!

DoorFlame/FlameSpark/Firebackground - the fires above doors. Turns out these are quite complex for what they are. I actually never noticed the little sparks flying out of the fire until now.

Slurg - mostly done.

BirdPortal - mostly done.

AbilityRing - mostly done.

Mudokon - more AI/brain states.

SlapLock - mostly done (actually works in standalone including the rings, so that goal was reached :)).

Other - more misc functions, bug fixes and of course more bugs added ;).

Next month the goal is simply to keep on progressing as many game objects as possible. There is a lot of reversing work left to be done on major objects such as Paramite/Scrab etc which can result in it looking like much isn't being done. Only when this is done can it start to be implemented in the code base.


The usual bugs/glitches/random things from testing:
