Sound rewrite progress is stalled at this point and probably will be very slowly chipped away at.

I would say some IRL issues have messed things up slightly, but then again I'm sure the current situation has done that to most people ;).

The main big news is that reversing of Abe's Oddysee has started. This was not something I planned to do originally because its another massive piece of work. But the initial pass of grouping/naming functions is nearing completion.

I've been live streaming quite a bit of this either in the Discord server, youtube or twitch. I've jumped around services quite a bit as I am new to streaming.

You can see a couple here: <https://www.twitch.tv/paulsapps/videos> for the next 30 days before twitch deletes them. Although its probably not very interesting to watch when it isn't live due to lack of interaction.

Check the road map image created by Dark and Mouzedrift - this gives a good overview of the current state of play (disclaimer: this image is WIP and the roadmap is probably also subject to change :)).
