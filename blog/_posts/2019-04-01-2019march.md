March update

The raw progress for March stands at:


Overall Complete functions: 45.61 % (1347/2953)

Overall Complete instructions: 41.78 % (98820/236504)

For once this is actually less than I expected. Mostly probably due to some IRL issues such as my health and other stuff meaning that I spent most spare time occupied with other things.

Noteworthy changes:

-Greeter and motion detector have been fully implemented. 

-The FlyingSlig object has been started.

-Building with CMake built into VS2017 now works out of the box with ninja as the build driver.

-Building for Raspberry PI was fixed after someone opened an issue about it. Their video can be seen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn0BFgSjzA8 

-Many other misc functions and fixes implemented.

-Github issues/bugs view project added to sort bugs by original game issues, re-implementation issues and new sub system (SDL2) issues.


Mlg also appeared to contribute a little this month:


-Progressed the slam door implementation more.

-Attempted to fix some sound issues but unfortunately there seems to be quite a few regressions at this time.
