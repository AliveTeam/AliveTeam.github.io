There hasn't been an update for a while as I've been in bad health recently and quite busy with "real" life stuff. The current state of the project is..... more crash bugs have been found in the original game that will need to be fixed and also some progress on the 2nd rewrite of the sound engine.

FluidSynth seems like a nice replacement for the custom written sound synth, however playing more than 1 track seems to have issues that I haven't worked out yet. Additionally the sound data will need a conversion step to convert to sf2 sound font file format.

There has been a little more progress on the MGS1 reversing - the main executable is 11% complete, or rather 11% of the bytes that make up the code section of the executable is now decompiled.

For next month I'm still not expecting any massive leaps in Oddworld or MGS progress. Unless of course others start to contribute more but that seems unlikely ;).

Interesting note: The illness I had here might have well been the current one spreading across the globe. Personally I hope it was as it would hopefully mean I am immune now!
