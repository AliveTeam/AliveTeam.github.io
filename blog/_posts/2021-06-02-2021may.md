Hello all,

This month we've reached an awesome improvement in the reversal of Abe's Oddysee, finally FMVs play
in the new engine. While there are some minor fixes that still need to be done to make the cutscenes
look and sound exactly in the original game, they can already be enjoyed in all of their glory and
what's more in native resolutions.

Paul has also put out a new post on the project's Patreon, which you can read
[here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/may-2021-update-51975414), it goes a bit deeper into the things
currently in the works.

And now let's see the rest of this month's changes:
