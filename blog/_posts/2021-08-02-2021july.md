Hello all,

This month has been spent mostly with BTS work, normalizing code that still mostly used cryptic and
unreadable variable names and outdated functions. These are necessary foundations for the eventual
inclusion of modding and also makes understanding the code far easier. Paul has continued work on
reversing the sound code, which should in time result in music that matches the PSX edition's audio
quality instead of the botched PC port's.

And with this out of the way, here's this month's list:

### [Paul]
- Continued work on reversing the sound library.
- Fixed [bug #1304](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/issues/1304)
- Implemented Animation database support for AO.
- Named fields in:
  - `Animation`
  - `BaseAnimatedWithPhysicsGameObject`
- Fixed a conversion bug that broke ARM support.

### [Mouzedrift]
- Added several enums, including one for `Gibs`, one for `BackgroundGlukkon`s, color tints, etc.
- Replaced magic numbers in many files to use named constants instead. (See
  [list](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/pull/1331/files?file-filters%5B%5D=))
- Split the `RockSack` object into multiple files.
- Renamed fields to human readable names (See
  [list](https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/pull/1332/files))
- Normalized code in several files to fit to the codebase more.
- Readded the orange ring effect to bird portals in AE.
- Normalized the names of AI states from `Brain` to `Motion`

### [GproKaru]
- Added documentation to animations based on ID.
