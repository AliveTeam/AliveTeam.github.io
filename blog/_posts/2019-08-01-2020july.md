I made a small progress video at the 60% mark, check it out:

The mine car update function was one of the biggest functions in the game taking quiet a few days to finish. At first it appeared that not much would be done this month but as always I somehow managed to do tons in the final week.


Next month I'll have a lot less time to work on the project but again the plan is to keep smashing through more functions. At this point a few functions are being decompiled without understanding their purpose which isn't something I've done often previously. However this helps speed things along and it can be retrospectively documented.
