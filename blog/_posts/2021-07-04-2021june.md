Hello all,

This month most took a break, so not many changes have happened. However, we are pleased to announce
that the team [started working](https://github.com/AliveTeam/sound_rev) on replicating a sound
system faithful to the PSX's, which in layman's terms means better sounding audio with additional
effects like percussion and reverb which are not present in the original PC version. Check out the
video below for a comparison:

</center>

Also I'd like to take the opportunity to remind you that we are still looking for playtesters and
bug reporters and are willing to provide the necessary support for you to get set up on our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/tTvhQ8w). So if you are interested in R.E.L.I.V.E., but didn't want to
give it a go until it's fully working, now's not a bad time to join the ride as both AO and AE are
playable from start to finish, with cutscenes and all.
