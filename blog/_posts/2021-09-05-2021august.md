Hello all,

Sadly this month I'm bringing bad news. Paul's PC broke down and this along with some health issues
prompted him to take a break from the project for a while. As he was the person who largely
coordinated the work on the project, this will likely mean that development will slow down in
the upcoming few months until he decides to return. We would like to ask you for your patience and
understanding.

On the other hand, before anyone starts to worry, this of course doesn't mean that the project is 'abandoned' or 'cancelled,' and
since the engine is already entirely playable, the development downtime is unlikely to affect most
players.

With this out of the way, this is August's changelog:
