      <p>
        R.E.L.I.V.E. proudly presents the new Level Editor, replacing the <a href="/legacy.html">legacy</a> <i>Paul's Level Editor,</i> featuring a lot more
        options; a brand new, more user-friendly UI; and a lot less unexpected crashes.
      </p>

      <div class="warning" id="backwards">
        <h3>No backwards compatibility!</h3>
        <p>
          Levels created using the new editor are only compatible with R.E.L.I.V.E. Trying to use them with the retail engine will most likely result in a crash
          or other unexpected bugs and glitches.
