    <h2>What? Why?</h2>
    <p><strong>R.E.L.I.V.E.</strong> is a fan effort to create a new engine, capable of replacing Digital Dialect's aging PC port for Oddworld's first two cult-classic games.</p>

    <p>More than twenty years after their release, both games struggle to run on modern platforms, usually requiring a third-party application like DxWnd just to run them properly.</p>
    <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. intends to become a complete replacement of both the original AbeWin.exe and any third-party tools, by providing both convenience and compatibility features like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Running the game in <strong>native resolutions</strong>,</p></li>
      <li><p>built-in support for <strong>switching between fullscreen</strong> and <strong>windowed mode</strong>,</p></li>
      <li><p>Native support for both <strong>MacOS</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>,</p></li>
      <li><p>The re-write uses the modern and cross-platform <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/index.php">SDL2 Graphics Library</a>, instead of the long deprecated DirectDraw API.</p></li>
      <li><p>A fully <a href="https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing">open-source codebase</a>, which you can freely use for your own projects or extend as you see fit.</p></li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Install guide</h3>
      <p>First things first, while the engine is free and will stay free, it doesn't come with the
      game's data. If you want to use it, you need to own either the GOG or Steam version of the
      games.</p>
      <p>Secondly, while there is an Abe's Oddysee version packed with the downloads, it doesn't
      work currently and will crash without much fanfare. <strong>Currently only Abe's Exoddus is
      playable.</strong></p>

        <p>If you are an Arch Linux user, you can simply download the engine from
          the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>. The package is
          called <code>relive-git</code>.</p>

      <h2>Here be Scrabs!</h2>
      <p>While the part of the engine responsible for Exoddus is playable from start to finish already, the experience is currently not bug-free. You can see the list of OG and reimplementation-caused bugs <a href="https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/projects/1">here.</a> Also native gamepad support currently only works on Windows.</p>

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>After the engine is fully reimplemented, the focus will shift on new features that which were never part of the original.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More platforms (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3p4Q9D_KYo">sneak peek</a>).</li>
        <li>Subtitles for cutscenes.</li>
        <li>Fixing the original games' bugs.</li>
        <li>Modding support.</li>
        <li>Level editor.</li>
        <li>Higher-resolution textures.</li>
