  <p>An Open-Source Abe's Oddysee/Exoddus Engine Reimplementation</p>

    <h2>What? Why?</h2>
    <p><strong>R.E.L.I.V.E.</strong> is a fan effort to create a new engine, capable of replacing Digital Dialect's aging PC port for Oddworld's first two cult-classic games.</p>

    <p>More than twenty years after their release, both games struggle to run on modern platforms, usually requiring a third-party application like DxWnd just to run them properly.</p>
    <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. intends to become a complete replacement of both the original AbeWin.exe and any third-party tools, by providing both convenience and compatibility features like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Running the game in <strong>native resolutions</strong>,</p></li>
      <li><p>built-in support for <strong>switching between fullscreen</strong> and <strong>windowed mode</strong>,</p></li>
      <li><p>Native support for both <strong>MacOS</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>,</p></li>
      <li><p>The re-write uses the modern and cross-platform <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/index.php">SDL2 Graphics Library</a>, instead of the long deprecated DirectDraw API.</p></li>
      <li><p>A fully <a href="https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing">open-source codebase</a>, which you can freely use for your own projects or extend as you see fit.</p></li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Here be Scrabs!</h2>
      <p>While the part of the engine responsible for Exoddus is playable from start to finish already, the experience is currently not bug-free. You can see the list of OG and reimplementation-caused bugs <a href="https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/projects/1">here. Also native gamepad support currently only works on Windows.</a></p>

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>After the engine is fully reimplemented, the focus will shift on new features that which were never part of the original.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More platforms (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3p4Q9D_KYo">sneak peek</a>).</li>
        <li>Subtitles for cutscenes.</li>
        <li>Fixing the original games' bugs.</li>
        <li>Modding support.</li>
        <li>Level editor.</li>
        <li>Higher-resolution textures.</li>
