        <h1>R.E.L.I.V.E.</h1>
        <p><strong>R.E.L.I.V.E.</strong> is a fan effort to create a new engine, capable of replacing Digital Dialect's aging
          PC port for Oddworld's first two cult-classic games.</p>
        <p>More than twenty years after their release, both games struggle to run on modern platforms, usually requiring a
          third-party application like DxWnd just to run them properly.</p>
        <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. intends to become a complete replacement of both the original AbeWin.exe/Exoddus.exe and any
          third-party tools, by providing both convenience and compatibility features like:</p>

          <h3>Native Resolution Support</h3>
          <p>It doesn't matter if your monitor is FullHD, 4k or perhaps an old rectangle CRT monitor, R.E.L.I.V.E. supports all.</p>
        <li class="popup">
          <h3>Windowed mode</h3>
          <p>No more need for DxWnd or similar, simply press F12 and the game goes into windowed mode or back to fullscreen on the fly.</p>
        <li class="popup">
          <h3>Modern Platforms</h3>
          <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. natively supports <strong>Windows 10</strong>, <strong>MacOS</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>
        <li class="popup">
          <h3>Modern Technologies</h3>
          <p>The re-write uses the modern and cross-platform <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/index.php">SDL2 Graphics Library</a>, instead of the long deprecated DirectDraw API.</p>
        <li class="popup">
          <h3>Open Source</h3>
          <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. is a fully <a href="https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing">open-source codebase</a>, which you can freely use for your own projects or extend as you see fit.</p>

        <h3>Here be Scrabs!</h3>
        <p>While the part of the engine responsible for Exoddus is playable from start to finish already, the experience is currently not bug-free. You can see the list of OG and reimplementation-caused bugs <a href="https://github.com/AliveTeam/alive_reversing/projects/1">here.</a> Also native gamepad support currently only works on Windows.</p>
      </div>

      <p>First things first: while the engine is free and will stay free, it doesn't come with the
      game's data. If you want to use it, you need to own either the GOG or Steam version of the
      games. If you don't own the games, you can buy them <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/buy-games/">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Secondly, while there is an Abe's Oddysee version packed with the downloads, it doesn't
      work currently and will crash without much fanfare. <strong>Currently only Abe's Exoddus is
      playable.</strong></p>
