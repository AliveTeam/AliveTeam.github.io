        <h1>R.E.L.I.V.E.</h1>
        <p><strong>R.E.L.I.V.E.</strong> is a fan effort to create a new engine, capable of replacing Digital Dialect's aging
          PC port for Oddworld's first two cult-classic games.</p>
        <p>More than twenty years after their release, both games struggle to run on modern platforms, usually requiring a
          third-party application like DxWnd just to run them properly.</p>
        <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. intends to become a complete replacement of both the original AbeWin.exe/Exoddus.exe and any

          While currently both Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus are in a playable state, both can present unexpected bugs, 
          crashes and other regressions from the base game. We're working hard on fixing these and your reports help a lot to 
          nail down where the issues are. If you'd like to see the list of current bugs or report one yourself feel free to check

        <h3>You have to own the games!</h3>
        <p>R.E.L.I.V.E. is a passion project created by fans and it will always be free to download
        and to tinker with. However, since it is just an engine, you have to own the actual game
        files to use the project.</p>
        <p>The developers behind R.E.L.I.V.E. do not condone piracy and will never provide the game
        files to anyone.</p>
